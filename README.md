**Discussion**

This project looked at whether there are income differences between men and women and how factors like job type and hours worked per week play a role. Using a logistic regression model, we found that factors such as education level, marital status, job type, relationship status, capital gains, and capital losses were the most important predictors of income (>50K). Surprisingly, gender itself wasn’t one of the key factors in the final model.

Our initial analysis showed that men are more likely to earn over $50K than women. However, when other factors like education and job type were considered, gender’s influence on income became less important. This suggests that income differences might be more about structural issues, like the kinds of jobs or education levels people have, rather than gender alone.

The model had an accuracy of 83.32%, meaning it performed well in predicting income. However, some issues, like imbalanced data (more people earning less than $50K) and extreme values in capital gains and losses, might have affected the results. Improving the model by adding interactions between variables or trying other methods like random forests could make it better.

Future studies could explore why certain jobs or education levels have such a big impact on income. Adding more data about workplace policies or cultural factors could also help us understand income differences better. These findings are a step toward identifying ways to reduce income inequalities.
